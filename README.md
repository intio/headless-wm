# Headless WM

This is a purely headless, API-driven, X11 window manager. It is meant
for kiosks, public displays, and other situations where interaction
with the screen / machine is limited (for users and/or staff), and
some form of remote control over the display is necessary.

It has no keybindings, no window decorations, no workspaces; it's
almost completely bare-bones except for keeping a list of
active/managed clients, which can be manipulated through an HTTP API.
